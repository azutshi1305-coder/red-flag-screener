Prepare the list of companies for the Pharma red-flag screener.

This script does two things:
1. build_company_list(): reads the official Nifty Pharma constituents file
   and saves a clean list of companies with their Yahoo Finance tickers.
2. check_tickers(): confirms each ticker is recognised by Yahoo Finance by
   asking for the last few days of prices.

Why check tickers: before we download years of financial statements, we
want to know every ticker points to a live NSE-listed stock. If Yahoo
returns recent prices, the ticker is valid. If it returns nothing, the
ticker is wrong, the stock is delisted/suspended, or Yahoo does not cover it.

Run from the project root:
    python src/prepare_companies.py
